Montreal cyclist counts data viz

*** TODOs

- Geocode all the accident locations. So far I have only done the
  accidents that happened on Rachel and Maisonneuve. Since the address
  data is not very good it is difficult to find a precise address
  using automatic geocoding services like ggmap + google maps API. Is
  there another way to lookup lat/lon data for each accident?
- Plot accidents for the selected month on a bigger map of Montreal
  (not just downtown).
- look at other counter data to see if they are consistent with the
  ones we already have plotted, and to see if they supply any info
  where it was missing before.

*** 30 Nov 2015 counters + counter locations + bike paths

- joined counter locations with counter data.

*** 28 Nov 2015 bike paths and counters

- got data for bike paths.
- got data for counter locations.

*** 26 Nov 2015 Bike accidents data

in Rachel and Maisonneuve bike paths]].

- [[file:accidents.R]] reads data from csv files into R.
- [[file:places.R]] uses google maps to determine the geographic
  coordinates (lat/lon) of each accident. Improved the accuracy of the
  positions by verifying on google maps and writing positions in
  [[file:manual.geocodes.csv]].
- [[file:figure-places.R]] plots the data:

The Makefile documents the workflow:
first I downloaded the data from the
[[http://donnees.ville.montreal.qc.ca/][Montreal Data Portal]],
then I unzip the csv files and read them into velos.RData using velos.R,
and finally I produced an
[[http://bl.ocks.org/tdhock/raw/ccd2c65933631f454c09/][animated interactive data visualization]]
using
[[https://github.com/tdhock/animint/wiki/Gallery][my animint R package]]
and the [[file:figure-timeseries.R]] script.

To reproduce the analysis make sure to copy the works_with_R function from works_with.R
to your ~/.Rprofile where it will be read every time you start R.
