in Rachel and Maisonneuve bike paths]].

- [[file:accidents.R]] reads data from csv files into R.
- [[file:places.R]] uses google maps to determine the geographic
  coordinates (lat/lon) of each accident. Improved the accuracy of the
  positions by verifying on google maps and writing positions in
  [[file:manual.geocodes.csv]].
- [[file:figure-places.R]] plots the data:

The Makefile documents the workflow:
first I downloaded the data from the
[[http://donnees.ville.montreal.qc.ca/][Montreal Data Portal]],
then I unzip the csv files and read them into velos.RData using velos.R,
and finally I produced an
[[http://bl.ocks.org/tdhock/raw/ccd2c65933631f454c09/][animated interactive data visualization]]
using
[[https://github.com/tdhock/animint/wiki/Gallery][my animint R package]]
and the figure-timeseries.R script.

To reproduce the analysis make sure to copy the works_with_R function from works_with.R
to your ~/.Rprofile where it will be read every time you start R.
