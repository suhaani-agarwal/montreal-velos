Montreal cyclist counts data viz

*** TODOs

- rajouter tous les autres accidents (actuellement j'ai régardé
  seulement les accidents sur Maisonneuve et Rachel)
- look at other counter data to see if they are consistent with the
  ones we already have plotted, and to see if they supply any info
  where it was missing before.
- still need to join accidents to the main time series + map plot
  (maybe totals per month, maybe not?)

*** 30 Nov 2015 counters + counter locations + bike paths

- joined counter locations with counter data.

*** 28 Nov 2015 bike paths and counters

[[file:figure-bike-paths.png]]
- got data for bike paths.
- got data for counter locations.

*** 26 Nov 2015 Bike accidents data

in Rachel and Maisonneuve bike paths]].

- [[file:accidents.R]] reads data from csv files into R.
- [[file:places.R]] uses google maps to determine the geographic
  coordinates (lat/lon) of each accident. Improved the accuracy of the
  positions by verifying on google maps and writing positions in
  [[file:manual.geocodes.csv]].
- [[file:figure-places.R]] plots the data:

*** 22 Oct 2014 Montreal Data Meetup

The Makefile documents the workflow:
first I downloaded the data from the
[[http://donnees.ville.montreal.qc.ca/][Montreal Data Portal]],
then I unzip the csv files and read them into velos.RData using velos.R,
and finally I produced an
[[http://bl.ocks.org/tdhock/raw/ccd2c65933631f454c09/][animated interactive data visualization]]
using
[[https://github.com/tdhock/animint/wiki/Gallery][my animint R package]]
and the [[file:figure-timeseries.R]] script.

To reproduce the analysis make sure to copy the works_with_R function from works_with.R
to your ~/.Rprofile where it will be read every time you start R.
